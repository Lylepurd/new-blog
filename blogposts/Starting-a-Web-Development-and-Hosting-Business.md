Here’s my story and the steps I took to turn this vision into reality.

- **The Inspiration**
The idea for Lyle/Dev began to take shape as I noticed the growing importance of websites for businesses of all sizes. I realized that many small and medium-sized businesses were struggling to establish a professional online presence. With a background in web development and a passion for technology, I saw an opportunity to make a difference by providing affordable, high-quality web development and hosting services.

- **Laying the Groundwork**
**Market Research**: The first step was understanding the market. I conducted thorough research to identify the needs of businesses in my target area and analyzed the competition. This helped me pinpoint gaps in the market and tailor my services to meet the specific demands of my future clients.

**Business Plan**: Armed with market insights, I created a detailed business plan. This included outlining my business goals, identifying my target audience, defining the services I would offer, and crafting a pricing strategy. The plan served as my roadmap, guiding me through each stage of setting up Lyle/Dev.

- **Finding My Niche**
Specializing in a particular niche can set a business apart from the competition. For Lyle/Dev, I decided to focus on creating dynamic, user-friendly websites for small and medium-sized businesses. By honing in on this niche, I could tailor my marketing efforts and develop a deep understanding of my clients' needs.

The website had to be user-friendly, visually appealing, and optimized for search engines to attract and retain visitors.
